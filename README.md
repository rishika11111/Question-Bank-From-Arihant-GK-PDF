# Question-Bank-From-Arihant-GK-PDF

This is a sample for text formating from a PDF file in Python.

The input is first converted to a text document using the PyPDF2 library.

Then the questions, with the options, and the answers are extracted from the file.

Finally,  sample output is shown on the screen.

As the output is too large, the entire output is written into a text file.
